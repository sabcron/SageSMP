This plugin was originally designed by me, sabcron, for a Minecraft SMP, the plugin adds a custom sword called the SageSword which can be crafted with a Dragon Egg, you also can only hold up to 16 ender pearls into your inventory and you cannot put the Dragon Egg or SageSword in ender chests. PVP also toggles globally every 30 minutes.
